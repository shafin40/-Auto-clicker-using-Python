# -Auto-clicker-using-Python
This Python script allows the user to start and stop automatic clicking by pressing the 'm' key. The script uses the pyautogui library to simulate mouse clicks and the keyboard library to detect key presses. The clicking can be stopped by pressing the 'm' key again, and the script can be exited by pressing the 'q' key.
